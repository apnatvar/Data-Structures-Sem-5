Hello reader,
 
This repository has been made to store I wrote for various assignments throughout my fifth semester at Trinity College Dublin. 

The module is Data Structures and Algorithms and as the name suggests it focusses on the various data structures present/built in C like Hash Tables, Arrays, Trees, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Graphs.

It also comprised of various algorithms such as Prim's, BFS, DFS, A*, Dijkstra. Some of these have been implemented in the codes present for the relevant assignment. Each folder contains the final submission for each assignment only. Initially provided material/skeletons/pdfs may be absent. 

Some of the code has been adpated from various sources and as such has been mentioned in the code and the report summarasing all the codes for each assignment. 

I hope you will find these helpful in completing your assignments/for general learning.
